Three beginner friendly projects to consolidate knowledge

ChatGPT gave me these three basic projects to work on:

Here are three beginner-friendly Python project ideas:

1. Simple Calculator
Description: Build a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Features:
    Prompt the user to input two numbers.
    Ask the user to choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
    Perform the selected operation and display the result.
Skills Practiced: User input, basic arithmetic, conditional statements.

2. Number Guessing Game
Description: Create a game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it. The computer will give hints if the guess is too high or too low.
Features:
    Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
    Allow the user to input guesses.
    Provide feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
    Count the number of attempts and display it when the game ends.
Skills Practiced: Random number generation, loops, conditionals, user input/output.

3. Mad Libs Game
Description: Create a Mad Libs game where the program asks the user for a list of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) and inserts them into a story template.
Features:
    Ask the user for various words (e.g., a noun, a verb, an adjective).
    Insert the user's words into a pre-written story template.
    Display the completed story with the user's words.
Skills Practiced: String formatting, user input, working with text.

These projects are simple, fun, and a great way to get comfortable with basic Python concepts.
